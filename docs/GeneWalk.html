Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  .gitignore
    Untracked:  code/
    Untracked:  data/Input/TFs/
    Untracked:  data/Input/wgEncodeRegTfbsClusteredV3.bed.gz
    Untracked:  data/Output/

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<p>In this section I am looking at the genes within each of the regions and use the GeneWalk tool in Python to find terms associated with the genes in each of the regions. While I intially focused on all of the genes within each of the given regions (section 1), I don’t know how useful this is, so I went back in my second analysis and just looked at genes that had correlation coefficient values of -0.5 in the second section.</p>
<p>GeneWalk references: <a href="http://churchman.med.harvard.edu/genewalk" class="uri">http://churchman.med.harvard.edu/genewalk</a> <a href="https://github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk" class="uri">https://github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk</a></p>

library(DT)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>load(file = &#39;../data/Output/df_pairs_cor_methsd_chromhmm_TF&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Here I am preparing csv files that contain the lists of genes for each region that will be fed into GeneWalk. I repeat this again using only significantly negatively correlated genes below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Prep for PMDs

PMDs.all &lt;- subset(df.pairs.FINAL, df.pairs.FINAL$region == &#39;commonPMD&#39;)
PMDs.all &lt;- PMDs.all %&gt;% arrange(correlation)
PMDs.all &lt;- unique(PMDs.all$symbol)
PMDs.all &lt;- data.frame(gene = PMDs.all)

write.csv(PMDs.all, &quot;../data/Output/pmd_genes.csv&quot;,
          row.names = FALSE)

#Prep for HMDs

HMDs.all &lt;- subset(df.pairs.FINAL, df.pairs.FINAL$region == &#39;commonHMD&#39;)
HMDs.all &lt;- HMDs.all %&gt;% arrange(correlation)
HMDs.all &lt;- unique(HMDs.all$symbol)
HMDs.all &lt;- data.frame(gene = HMDs.all)

write.csv(HMDs.all, &quot;../data/Output/hmd_genes.csv&quot;,
          row.names = FALSE)

#Prep for Neither

neither.all &lt;- subset(df.pairs.FINAL, df.pairs.FINAL$region == &#39;neither&#39;)
neither.all &lt;- neither.all %&gt;% arrange(correlation)
neither.all &lt;- unique(neither.all$symbol)
neither.all &lt;- data.frame(gene = neither.all)

write.csv(neither.all, &quot;../data/Output/neither_genes.csv&quot;,
          row.names = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>!Before the GW program can be run the gene symbols in the above CSV files need to be converted to HGNC IDs, this can be done using the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.genenames.org/tools/multi-symbol-checker/" class="uri">https://www.genenames.org/tools/multi-symbol-checker/</a></p>
<p>The next chunk is the bash code used to run GeneWalk. Importantly, because I don’t have admin privileges on the computer that I ran this analysis on I had to use a virtual environment (VE) in which I installed GeneWalk and ran the analysis.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>
bash --version
#setting up virtual environment
source ~/Desktop/VE/VE-env/bin/activate

#example of one of the GW runs 
genewalk --project hmds --genes hmd_genes.csv --id_type hgnc_symbol --nproc 8
#Change project ^,          gene list ^,          symbol type ^,      cores ^   to desired names/specs
</code></pre>
<p>Regarding the results obtained from the GeneWalk analysis:</p>
<p>“The output of GeneWalk is a comma separated text file genewalk_results.csv with GO annotations (go_name and go_id columns) ranked quantitatively by statistical significance, the mean FDR adjusted p-value (mean_padj), for each input gene.”</p>
<p>“Next, GeneWalk calculates whether a cosine similarity value between a gene and GO term is higher than expected by chance using a significance test. By comparing the similarity to similarity values between node vectors arising from random networks, we obtain a p-value. Because a gene can have multiple GO annotations, we apply a multiple testing correction (Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate FDR procedure), yielding a corrected p-adjust value. This procedure is repeated multiple times to retrieve a robust mean estimate (mean p-adjust) and its uncertainty (95% confidence interval) as final statistical significance relevance results.”</p>

<p>While the above analysis is interesting, looking at all genes is probably not the most useful. I am therefore going to run the GeneWalk analysis again using specifically significantly (&lt; -0.5) negatively correlated genes for each region.</p>

<p>Regarding the results obtained from the GeneWalk analysis:</p>
<p>“The output of GeneWalk is a comma separated text file genewalk_results.csv with GO annotations (go_name and go_id columns) ranked quantitatively by statistical significance, the mean FDR adjusted p-value (mean_padj), for each input gene.”</p>
<p>“Next, GeneWalk calculates whether a cosine similarity value between a gene and GO term is higher than expected by chance using a significance test. By comparing the similarity to similarity values between node vectors arising from random networks, we obtain a p-value. Because a gene can have multiple GO annotations, we apply a multiple testing correction (Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate FDR procedure), yielding a corrected p-adjust value. This procedure is repeated multiple times to retrieve a robust mean estimate (mean p-adjust) and its uncertainty (95% confidence interval) as final statistical significance relevance results.”</p>

<p>Interestingly it looks like one of the genes identified in the GeneWalk that showed significance and is within a PMD is KRT5, which is a favorable prognostic marker in breast cancer - perhaps something to look at more?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the top three most negatively correlated genes in PMDs (MAEL, TMEM26, and OR51E2) did not show any association with any GO term, a bit weird - might run the analysis again.</p>
