Here the final 'df.pairs.FINAL' table can be looked at. This is done using server-side processing in the DT package and shiny.  

DT: https://rstudio.github.io/DT/server.html

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(DT)
```

```{r}
load(file = '../data/Output/df_pairs_cor_methsd_chromhmm_TF')
```

The code below is to get server-side processing, but I can't seem to get it to work. Although I get a warning message that client-side processing doesn't work, the table seems to show up fine (see second code chunk)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
renderDataTable(df.pairs.FINAL, server = TRUE)
```

```{r}
DT::datatable(df.pairs.FINAL)
```

The data table below shows the hg19 genome in 100kb bins classified by region according to the first paper listed in the Regions_and_PRAD.Rmd file. 

```{r}
load(file = '../data/Output/df.regions')
DT::datatable(df.regions)
```
